# Glossary

A comprehensive glossary of terms and concepts used throughout psake documentation.

## Build Terms

### Build Script

A PowerShell script containing psake task definitions, typically named `psakefile.ps1` or `default.ps1`. The build script defines all tasks, properties, and build logic for your project.

```powershell
# Example build script
Properties {
    $BuildDir = './build'
}

Task Default -depends Build

Task Build {
    exec { dotnet build }
}
```

### Build File

Another term for a [build script](#build-script). The file that contains your psake build definitions.

### Build Artifacts

Output files generated by the build process, such as compiled binaries, packages, documentation, or deployment files. Typically stored in a dedicated directory like `build/`, `dist/`, or `artifacts/`.

## Core Concepts

### Task

A named unit of work in a psake build script. Tasks are the building blocks of your build automation. Each task can have dependencies, preconditions, postconditions, and actions to perform.

```powershell
Task Build {
    # Task action
    Write-Host "Building project..."
    exec { dotnet build }
}
```

**Key characteristics:**
- Has a unique name
- Contains PowerShell code to execute
- Can depend on other tasks
- Runs exactly once per build (unless called via `Invoke-Task`)

See also: [Task Dependency](#task-dependency), [Default Task](#default-task)

### Task Dependency

A relationship between tasks where one task requires another task to run first. Dependencies are declared using the `-depends` parameter.

```powershell
Task Test -depends Build {
    exec { dotnet test }
}
```

In this example, the `Build` task must complete successfully before `Test` runs.

**Dependency resolution:**
- Dependencies run before the dependent task
- Each dependency runs only once per build
- Circular dependencies cause build failure
- Dependencies can be chained (transitive)

See also: [Task](#task)

### Default Task

The task that runs when you invoke psake without specifying a task name. Typically used to run the most common build workflow.

```powershell
Task Default -depends Clean, Build, Test

# These are equivalent:
Invoke-psake
Invoke-psake -taskList Default
```

**Best practices:**
- Always define a Default task
- Make it run your standard build workflow
- Use it for the most common developer scenario

### Property

A variable defined in the `Properties` block of a build script. Properties hold configuration values that can be overridden via parameters.

```powershell
Properties {
    $Configuration = 'Release'
    $OutputPath = './build'
    $Version = '1.0.0'
}
```

Properties are available throughout the build script and can be referenced in any task.

See also: [Parameter](#parameter), [Properties Block](#properties-block)

### Parameter

A value passed to the build script at invocation time. Parameters override default property values.

```powershell
# In psakefile.ps1
Properties {
    $Configuration = 'Debug'  # Default value
}

# Invoke with parameter
Invoke-psake -parameters @{
    Configuration = 'Release'  # Override default
}
```

**Common uses:**
- Environment selection (Dev, Staging, Production)
- Build configuration (Debug, Release)
- Version numbers
- Feature flags

See also: [Property](#property)

### Properties Block

A special block in the build script where properties are defined and initialized. Can appear multiple times in a script, and properties can be defined in any order.

```powershell
Properties {
    $BuildDir = Split-Path $psake.build_script_file
    $Configuration = 'Release'
}

Properties {
    $ArtifactsDir = Join-Path $BuildDir 'artifacts'
}
```

See also: [Property](#property)

## Execution Control

### Precondition

A test that must pass before a task executes. If the precondition fails, the task is skipped (not executed, not failed).

```powershell
Task Deploy -precondition { $Environment -eq 'Production' } {
    # Only runs if Environment is Production
    exec { ./deploy.ps1 }
}
```

**Use cases:**
- Environment-specific tasks
- Conditional execution based on configuration
- Skip tasks when prerequisites aren't met

See also: [Postcondition](#postcondition)

### Postcondition

A test that must pass after a task completes. If the postcondition fails, the build fails.

```powershell
Task Build -postcondition { Test-Path './build/app.dll' } {
    exec { dotnet build -o ./build }
}
```

**Use cases:**
- Verify task produced expected output
- Validate build artifacts exist
- Ensure task side effects occurred

See also: [Precondition](#precondition)

### Exec

A psake function that executes an external command and automatically fails the build if the command exits with a non-zero exit code.

```powershell
Task Build {
    exec { dotnet build }  # Fails build if dotnet returns error
}
```

Without `exec`, you'd need to manually check `$LASTEXITCODE`:

```powershell
Task Build {
    dotnet build
    if ($LASTEXITCODE -ne 0) {
        throw "Build failed"
    }
}
```

**Key features:**
- Automatic error detection
- Custom error messages
- Retry support with `-retry` parameter
- Working directory control

See also: [Exit Code](#exit-code)

### Assert

A psake function that tests a condition and fails the build if the condition is false.

```powershell
Task Validate {
    Assert (Test-Path './src') "Source directory not found"
    Assert ($Version -match '^\d+\.\d+\.\d+$') "Invalid version format"
}
```

**Use cases:**
- Validate prerequisites
- Check configuration values
- Verify file existence
- Test build assumptions

### Include

A psake directive that includes tasks and functions from another PowerShell file into your build script.

```powershell
# In psakefile.ps1
Include ./tasks/common-tasks.ps1
Include ./tasks/deploy-tasks.ps1

Task Build -depends CommonClean {
    # Can use tasks from included files
}
```

**Use cases:**
- Share tasks across multiple projects
- Organize large build scripts
- Reuse common build logic
- Team-wide build standards

See also: [Nested Build](#nested-build)

### Nested Build

Invoking one psake build script from within another. Used to build multi-project solutions or orchestrate complex builds.

```powershell
Task BuildSubprojects {
    Invoke-psake ./projectA/psakefile.ps1 -taskList Build
    Invoke-psake ./projectB/psakefile.ps1 -taskList Build
}
```

**When to use:**
- Multi-project solutions
- Monorepo builds
- Independent but related projects
- Coordinated build orchestration

See also: [Include](#include)

## Context and State

### $psake Variable

A special variable available in all build scripts that contains psake context information and configuration.

**Common properties:**
- `$psake.build_script_file` - Full path to current build script
- `$psake.build_script_dir` - Directory containing build script
- `$psake.version` - psake version number
- `$psake.context` - Build execution context

```powershell
Properties {
    $ProjectRoot = Split-Path $psake.build_script_file
    $BuildNumber = $psake.build_number
}

Task Info {
    Write-Host "psake version: $($psake.version)"
    Write-Host "Build script: $($psake.build_script_file)"
}
```

### Build Context

The execution environment and state of a psake build, including:
- Current task being executed
- Task call stack
- Properties and their values
- Build success/failure state

Accessible via `$psake.context`.

### Build Script File

The currently executing psake build file. Accessible via `$psake.build_script_file`.

```powershell
Properties {
    $ScriptDir = Split-Path $psake.build_script_file
    $ProjectRoot = Split-Path $ScriptDir
}
```

## Output and Formatting

### FormatTaskName

A configuration function that customizes how task names are displayed during build execution.

```powershell
FormatTaskName {
    param($taskName)
    Write-Host "===== $taskName =====" -ForegroundColor Cyan
}
```

**Use cases:**
- Custom task headers
- Visual separation of tasks
- Branding/styling build output
- Integration with logging systems

### Task Documentation

The `-description` parameter on tasks that provides help text. Displayed when running `Invoke-psake -docs`.

```powershell
Task Build -description "Compiles the solution" {
    exec { dotnet build }
}
```

```powershell
# View documentation
Invoke-psake -docs

# Output:
# Build         Compiles the solution
# Test          Runs all unit tests
# Deploy        Deploys to production
```

## Error Handling

### Exit Code

A numeric value returned by a program indicating success (0) or failure (non-zero). The `exec` function automatically checks exit codes.

```powershell
Task Build {
    exec { dotnet build }  # Checks $LASTEXITCODE automatically
}
```

**Common exit codes:**
- `0` - Success
- `1` - General error
- Other values - Application-specific errors

See also: [Exec](#exec), [Exit Code Reference](/docs/reference/exit-codes)

### ContinueOnError

A parameter for the `exec` function that allows build to continue even if a command fails.

```powershell
Task Test {
    # Continue even if tests fail
    exec { dotnet test } -continueOnError

    Write-Host "Tests completed (may have failures)"
}
```

**Use cases:**
- Optional operations
- Best-effort tasks
- Collecting multiple errors before failing

### MaxRetries

A parameter for the `exec` function that automatically retries failed commands.

```powershell
Task Deploy {
    # Retry up to 3 times on failure
    exec { ./deploy.ps1 } -maxRetries 3 -retryTriggerErrorPattern "timeout"
}
```

**Use cases:**
- Network operations
- Flaky external services
- Deployment to cloud resources
- Package publishing

## Build Framework

### Framework

The .NET Framework version to target. Specified via the `-framework` parameter when invoking psake.

```powershell
Invoke-psake -framework '4.8'
Invoke-psake -framework 'net6.0'
```

**Note:** This is primarily for legacy compatibility. Modern builds typically handle framework targeting via project files.

### psake Module

The PowerShell module that provides the psake build automation functionality. Installed from the PowerShell Gallery.

```powershell
# Install the module
Install-Module -Name psake -Scope CurrentUser

# Import the module
Import-Module psake

# Check version
Get-Module psake | Select-Object Version
```

### Invoke-psake

The main command that executes a psake build script.

```powershell
# Basic usage
Invoke-psake

# Specify build file and task
Invoke-psake -buildFile ./build.ps1 -taskList Build, Test

# Pass parameters
Invoke-psake -parameters @{ Configuration = 'Release' }

# Verbose output
Invoke-psake -Verbose

# Documentation mode
Invoke-psake -docs
```

**Key parameters:**
- `-buildFile` - Path to build script (default: psakefile.ps1)
- `-taskList` - Tasks to execute (default: Default)
- `-parameters` - Hashtable of parameters
- `-properties` - Alternative way to pass parameters
- `-framework` - .NET Framework version
- `-docs` - Show task documentation
- `-detailedDocs` - Show detailed task information

## CI/CD Terms

### Continuous Integration (CI)

The practice of automatically building and testing code changes. psake is commonly used as the build engine in CI pipelines.

**CI platforms that work with psake:**
- GitHub Actions
- Azure Pipelines
- GitLab CI
- Jenkins
- TeamCity

See also: [CI Examples](/docs/ci-examples/github-actions)

### Build Agent

A machine (physical or virtual) that executes CI/CD builds. Build agents run your psake scripts in automated fashion.

**Considerations for psake on build agents:**
- PowerShell availability
- psake module installation
- Environment variables
- Authentication/secrets

### Build Artifact

See [Build Artifacts](#build-artifacts)

### Environment Variable

Operating system variables used to pass configuration to build scripts. Commonly used in CI/CD to provide secrets and environment-specific values.

```powershell
Properties {
    $ApiKey = $env:API_KEY
    $Environment = $env:BUILD_ENVIRONMENT ?? 'Development'
}

Task Deploy {
    if ([string]::IsNullOrEmpty($ApiKey)) {
        throw "API_KEY environment variable is required"
    }

    exec { ./deploy.ps1 -ApiKey $ApiKey }
}
```

**Best practices:**
- Never hardcode secrets in build scripts
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Provide sensible defaults for local development
- Document required environment variables

## Advanced Concepts

### Task Alias

An alternative name for a task, created by defining a task that depends on another task without additional logic.

```powershell
Task Build {
    exec { dotnet build }
}

# Create alias
Task Compile -depends Build {
    # No additional logic - just an alias
}
```

### Task Hook

Using preconditions and postconditions to hook into task execution lifecycle.

```powershell
Task Build `
    -precondition { Write-Host "About to build..." } `
    -postcondition { Write-Host "Build complete!" } `
{
    exec { dotnet build }
}
```

### Shared Task Library

A collection of reusable tasks that can be included in multiple build scripts.

```powershell
# In shared-tasks.ps1
Task CommonClean {
    Remove-Item ./build -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
}

Task CommonRestore {
    exec { dotnet restore }
}

# In psakefile.ps1
Include ./shared-tasks.ps1

Task Build -depends CommonClean, CommonRestore {
    exec { dotnet build }
}
```

### Build Configuration

A set of build settings, typically `Debug` or `Release`, but can be any custom configuration name.

```powershell
Properties {
    $Configuration = 'Release'
}

Task Build {
    exec { dotnet build --configuration $Configuration }
}

# Invoke with different configuration
Invoke-psake -parameters @{ Configuration = 'Debug' }
```

### Task Graph

The directed acyclic graph (DAG) of task dependencies. psake resolves this graph to determine task execution order.

```powershell
Task Default -depends Test
Task Test -depends Build
Task Build -depends Clean, Restore

# Task graph: Clean, Restore → Build → Test → Default
# Execution order: Clean → Restore → Build → Test
```

**Key properties:**
- Must be acyclic (no circular dependencies)
- Determines execution order
- Each node executes at most once
- Respects declared dependencies

## Common Patterns

### Clean Build

Removing all build artifacts before building, ensuring a fresh build from source.

```powershell
Task Clean {
    Remove-Item ./build -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
}

Task Build -depends Clean {
    exec { dotnet build }
}
```

### Incremental Build

Building only what has changed since the last build. Faster than clean builds but requires careful change detection.

```powershell
Task IncrementalBuild {
    # Only rebuild if source is newer than output
    if ((Get-Item ./src).LastWriteTime -gt (Get-Item ./build).LastWriteTime) {
        exec { dotnet build --no-restore }
    }
}
```

### Build Pipeline

A series of tasks that represent the complete build workflow from clean to deploy.

```powershell
Task Default -depends Clean, Restore, Build, Test, Package, Deploy
```

### Conditional Task

A task that only runs when certain conditions are met, using preconditions.

```powershell
Properties {
    $Environment = 'Development'
}

Task DeployProd -precondition { $Environment -eq 'Production' } {
    exec { ./deploy-production.ps1 }
}
```
